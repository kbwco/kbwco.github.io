## Basic Rules
* Have fun
* Cards can change any rules (e.g. the rule that you can only play 1 card per turn can 
be changed by a card to allow you to play up to 3 cards per turn)
* Players should at least attempt to follow what the cards say to do
  * If someone has failed to do what a card says, if it's caught in the moment, 
  it should be corrected. But if it's caught sometime later when it no longer 
  matters, just move on.
* Any time you have a blank in your hand, you can create a new card from it. You do 
not need to wait until it's your turn to create a card. In theory, the card can do 
anything, but try to avoid "I win" / "you lose" cards and keep in mind that 
complex effects will be complex to actually carry out.

## Start of Game
* Cards made previously should be shuffled together with a bunch of blanks.
* To start the game, each player will be dealt 10 cards for their starting hand.
  * Note that your starting hand could include instant-play cards that must be played 
  immediately. If this happens, you don't get to draw back up to 10 cards.
* Who gets the first turn is decided by the players however they want to decide it.

## Your Hand
* 10 cards is neither a limit nor a minimum of cards in your hand, that's just the 
amount you start with. You can have any number of cards in your hand without 
having to discard or draw more. You would only discard or draw more if told so 
by a card in the game.

## Rotation
* Play proceeds clockwise from whoever had the first turn.
* On your turn, you must draw a card from the deck and play one card (you can only
play one card during your turn unless cards allow otherwise)

## Winning/Losing
* The default win condition is to simply be the last player who hasn't lost.
* The default lose condition is if you cannot draw during your turn due to the deck 
being empty, and cannot play during your turn (because you either have 0 cards in 
your hand, or all cards in your hand cannot be played)
* Usually these win and loss conditions don't matter and a card will end the game  
and/or specify conditions for who won/lost.

## Multiple Games
* If you play multiple games in a row, nothing transfers from one game to the next
(i.e. you can't carry over cards from your hand, the discard should be reshuffled 
into the deck, etc.)
