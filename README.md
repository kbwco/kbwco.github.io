## 1000 Blank White Cards
1000 Blank White Cards is a card game that anyone can play about creativity where 
anything can happen. You start by creating some cards that can do whatever you want 
them to do and shuffle them together with some blanks. If you have cards from 
previous games you can just use those instead of starting fresh. Where you go from 
there is up to you, but I usually deal 10 cards to each player and then during 
your turn, you must draw 1 card from the deck and play 1 card if you're able to. 
You can make cards that raise the limit of cards that can be played or drawn as well 
or prevent people from drawing.

I've played a bunch of games of 1000 Blank White Cards with my friends and that 
information is being added here over time. Feel free to look at it to get your 
own ideas of how to play and cards to make.

This site includes information about [how to play](/basics/GameplayBasics.html), 
[games I played with friends](/games.html), 
[cards me and my friends made](/cards.html), and more info related to those cards 
and how they are meant to be played.

## 1000 Blank White Cards Online
"1000 Blank White Cards Online" (abbreviated as KBWCO) refers to a computer version 
of 1000 Blank White Cards that I'd like to make eventually. The benefit of playing 
online would be to connect with friends who you can't meet up with in person, or 
to continue games over time if they don't end in one session, and so that complex 
effects could be automated rather than trying to figure them out on the fly.

Right now I'm focused more on TaduCore/TaduBoot, which would serve as the platform 
for 1000 Blank White Cards Online. Progress and more information about that can be 
found on the [Tadukooverse Github site](https://tadukooverse.github.io).
